For some reason I'm using GitHub as a free image hosting service. However a main problem is that GitHub doesn't have CDN in China, until I found jsDelivr.

jsDelivr is a free CDN for open source projects, which can host small files(no more than 20 MB).

Here is the link:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repo}@{version}/{file}
```
